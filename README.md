# pi-dgoal

[中文说明](./README-zh.md)

A Pi extension that keeps an agent working on a goal until completion is independently verified — through a Task Plan and a build-check loop.

> **v0.2.0**: Task Plan (goal/phase/task) with startup gate + live overlay + build-check loop + final audit. See [CHANGELOG](#) or `doc/30-路线图`.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-dgoal
```

Then reload Pi:

```text
/reload
```

For local development:

```json
// ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
"../../Documents/codes/Githubs/pi-dgoal"
```

## Usage

Start a goal with a Task Plan:

```text
/dgoal Fix the failing tests in this project and verify the result
```

The startup gate dialog shows a phase-level summary by default (goal + verification + phases + task counts), with an explicit entry to view task details on demand. Approve, reject, or give feedback before dgoal execution begins.

During dgoal execution:

- The agent updates task status via `dgoal_plan` (`pending → in_progress → done | blocked`).
- Each phase completion is independently audited via `dgoal_check` (isolated subprocess with limited verification tools, including `bash`).
- A live overlay above the editor shows phase progress; tasks default-hidden, follow Pi's `app.tools.expand` action (default `Ctrl+O`) when expanded, and show a single bottom line with the shortcut plus common command descriptions.
- User-facing overlay, status, notification, and startup-gate text can follow `pi-di18n` when that extension is installed; model-facing prompts and tool schemas stay unchanged.

Control the goal:

```text
/dgoal status | s   # center modal for full plan status, or an empty dgoal state when none is active
/dgoal pause  | p   # stop auto-continuation (keep goal)
/dgoal resume | r   # resume paused goal
/dgoal clear  | c   # remove goal from session
```

Declare completion (triggers final audit):

The agent calls `dgoal_done(summary, verification)`. If the final audit passes, the goal closes and dgoal execution stops.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dgoal_propose` | Startup gate: submit goal + phases + initial tasks. User confirms before dgoal execution begins. |
| `dgoal_plan` | CRUD on tasks (create / update / list / get). 4-state machine with `blockedBy` dependency tracking + cycle detection. |
| `dgoal_check` | Phase completion gate (spawns an isolated acceptance subprocess with fresh context and limited verification tools). Also the final-audit mechanism when called on the last phase. |
| `dgoal_done` | Declare goal completion. Triggers final audit internally; the only way to close a goal. |

## Design Boundaries

- Session-scoped: one active goal per Pi session. No global goal pool.
- Task Plan is mandatory: using `/dgoal` implies a compound goal that requires a plan. No empty-plan completion.
- Goal layer is frozen at gate confirmation; phase/task layers are adjustable during dgoal execution.
- Completed tasks don't roll back. A wrong step gets a follow-up task (`blockedBy` → original).
- Independent audit: the verifier is a separate `pi` subprocess with fresh context, no main-session history, no skills/extensions, and only limited verification tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`). Completion is not self-reported.
- No Git auto-actions, no replacement of project-specific tests, no fixed workflow engine.

## Goal Lifecycle

```text
pending ──→ active ──→ done                # happy path
              │  ↑
              ↓  │ rejected                # final audit failed; dgoal continues with audit report pinned
              │  │  ×3 final-audit failures
              ↓  ↓
            paused (audit_failed_3x) ──/dgoal resume──→ active
            paused (user_abort / model_error / audit_error) ──/dgoal resume──→ active
```

See `doc/术语表.md` for state definitions, `doc/决策档案/0004` for the rejected/paused contract, and `doc/10-架构与运行/` for the current implementation.

## Completion Audit

`dgoal_done` runs `dgoal_check` in final-audit mode: an isolated `pi` subprocess with fresh context and limited verification tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`).

```text
--no-session --no-extensions --no-skills --mode json --tools read,grep,find,ls,bash
```

- Approved: goal closes, dgoal execution stops, model receives a completion signal for the final user-facing reply.
- Rejected: goal enters `rejected`; the audit report is injected and pinned to each subsequent turn's prompt. Three consecutive rejections pause the goal; `/dgoal resume` clears the counter and retries.
- Audit error / abort / idle-timeout / no clear decision: goal is safely paused; `/dgoal resume` continues.
- Audit progress is streamed back through the tool call; if the check stops mid-way, partial output is still returned.
- Audit reports use a stricter acceptance style: GWT-like PASS / FAIL / BLOCKER items plus a code-and-doc consistency section.
- Escape hatch: `PI_DGOAL_NO_AUDIT=1` skips the audit (debugging only).

## Tests

```bash
npm test         # bun: full suite
npm run test:rpc # python: RPC loading + command registration
npm run test:smoke # python: AI-driven smoke (real model, isolated env) — costs real tokens
```

Test files cover data model + persistence, plan reducer (state machine + cycle detection), overlay rendering, startup gate, state machine + prompt, end-to-end integration, tool execute real-path integration, context hardening, and subprocess supervision for detached process-group cleanup.

**AI-driven smoke** (`npm run test:smoke`, `test/test-ai-smoke.py`): drives a real multi-phase dgoal in an isolated env (`pi -ne -e ./index.ts -ns -np --mode rpc`), auto-answering the startup-gate select and tracking the full `dgoal_propose → dgoal_plan → dgoal_check → dgoal_done` tool chain. Real model + real tokens, so not in CI.

**TUI interaction behavior** (startup gate confirm UI, real `dgoal_check` subprocess audit content, terminal rejected retry path, aboveEditor widget rendering) still requires a manual smoke test in the Pi TUI with a real model.
